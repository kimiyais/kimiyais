              All problems are relational problems. Despite how they might manifest (e.g.,
              inefficient processes, lack of product-market fit, cultural toxicity) they all stem
              from a misalignment within and between individuals and wider organizational structures.
              We remove relational blocks and create coherence so that individuals feel connected
              to themselves, each other, and to the organization ethos. The outcome is an
              organization that efficiently realizes its vision and mission and people who feel
              fulfilled.

                    feel confident investing resources. Tina showed us how to move quickly and

                    in front of users with as little over-engineering as possible. This gave our
